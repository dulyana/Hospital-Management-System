# Hospital-Management-System
## Days before, making an appointment and get treatment from a hospital was convenient and easy for people but when the outbreak arrives things changed a lot that even cold fever patients considered as virus carrier these days. So its riskier to give everyone an appointment to meet doctor. So we came up with a system to make an appointment via online that will enable doctors, patients, receptionists to create accounts and go through the processes to make an appointment for the specific patient. By going through the processes, patient can log into the system &amp; fill the form to request an appointment, when the patient’s form directed to the receptionist, he/she’ll add patients or update them in the list and receptionist will update doctor about the patient queue. When doctor logs into the system, his patient queue will update and he can arrange patient’s appointments. When all that done, receptionist can inform patient about their appointment details. This will be the flow of the process our system.
